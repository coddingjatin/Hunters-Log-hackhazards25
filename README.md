- Throughout this journey, we embraced rapid brainstorming, design iterations, technical hurdles, and last-minute pivots, but the vision stayed strong:
Help users "Train like a Hunter and Level Up like Jin-Woo" in real life.

- Building with React, TypeScript, Vite, and localStorage made us focus on delivering a blazing-fast, lightweight, and responsive product, while the Solo Leveling theme added a layer of motivation that traditional habit apps miss.
